I'm Hayden, and I apply data science and epidemiological methodologies to address challenges in healthcare. Population health is complex in nature. My scientific curiosity has helped me land a diverse portfolio, ranging from global health implementation to health economics and outcomes research (HEOR). Here, you will find source code for modelling, report automation, and general programming.
